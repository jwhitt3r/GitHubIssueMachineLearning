# GitHubIssueMachineLearning
A Multi Class Classification algorithm written with ML.NET with single, enumerable-based and file-based predictions based off the [Microsoft ML Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/github-issue-classification), however, adaptions have been made to make multi-predications and batch-predictions.

I have added further detail on the Application, which can be found at [Blog Post](https://www.exit.wtf/code/2019/08/15/GitHubIssues-MLDotnet.html)

## Output of Predictions for Singular, Enumerable, and File-based
